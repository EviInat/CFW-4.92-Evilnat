Following the 4.92 firmware update developer's from around the community have been updating various projects. This time around PS3 CFW developer @Evilnat drops by the forum and leave's us with a suite of ps3 custom firmware's that support 4.92 firmware. 4 Flavor's (CEX, PEX, D-PEX & DEX) are available for 4.92 Evilnat CFW, depending on your console/taste, all builds are equipped with the Cobra v8.5 payload to provide expanded feature set over Standard CFW's.

If you are already on PS3 CFW, updating is a breeze, you just need to install the new CFW PUP file via the official USB Method and you will be on Evilnat's latest release. If you have updated to 4.92 OFW you will have to wait, as you will have re-exploit your ps3 console to allow for a Custom Firmware installation once again. The good news is that developer @bguerville should be rolling out a new update soon for the PS3 Toolset that support 4.92 firmware. The offline tool CFW Flash Writer may take longer for the community to update it, but we hope to see an update for that tool soon as well.
